## Description

Forest Adventure is a mini exploration game where the player navigates along a path to a few key locations. 
Upon approaching these locations, the player is given a small text description of what is beyond which disappears when
the player leaves the area.

The main project file is project.py which contains all the code for the game, the only library that was used for this
project is PyGame.

The design of the project was very straightforward to implement. The largest hurdle during creation was
collision implementation. I ended up having to rework the player class and walls about half-way through the project
in order to properly utilise Rects which is how I opted to handle the collisions for my project. I found myself
referencing the previous "Digital Rain" project, some helpful tutorial blogs, as well as the PEP8 style guide at some
points to help complete the project.

If I were to come back in the future, I would love to implement some art to the project for things like the forest
walls and the player. I would also like to learn how to implement animation for things like text showing and
disappearing as well as a fade for when the player leaves. It would also be interesting to explore PyGame's 
audio system for things such as footsteps and forest ambience.

Overall, I am happy with how this project came out. However, I do believe I should have dedicated more time to
creating art for the game.
